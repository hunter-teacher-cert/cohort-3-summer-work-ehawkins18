The PhoneBook will be an ArrayList of person objects.
Each person object contains 3 strings:
  public class person {
    private String lastName;
    private String firstName;
    private String phoneNumber;
The PhoneBook will be sorted by lastName in ascending alphabetical order.
add: The add method will add a person object to the PhoneBook in its proper place (alphabetical order by lastName).
find: The find method will perform a binary search on the PhoneBook by lastName.
