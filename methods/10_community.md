### System: STUDENT RECRUITMENT

#### How It Works
Develop systems to promote our school's Computer Science CTE program to prospective students and their families.
* Develop collateral materials
  * Update brochure
  * Update recruitment section of school website
  * Design and order SWAG
* Create outreach plan
  * Attend in-person and virtual high school fairs
  * Create list of potential feeder schools
    * Get contact info for teachers, guidance counselors, and administrators
    * Schedule visits to/from feeder schools 
* Create an Articulation Team
  * Recruit and train students to represent the school and talk with prospective students and their families.
* Develop activities that Articulation Team students can facilitate for prospective students
  * at UA Maker
  * at Feeder Schools
* These activities could include (but are NOT limited to):
1. Hour of Code
2. Hack-a-Thon
3. Design Challenge



#### Expected Positive Outcomes

* Recruiting students who are excited about one or both of the CTE programs will raise student engagement. 
  * Our school is very focused on the 2 CTE pathways (Computer Science and Digital Media).
  * Students who are not interested in either of these programs do not have a "Plan B".
  * Focus on recruiting under-represented groups in CS.

#### Rollout Timeline
* Ongoing - formalize systems during the first year (2022-2023) and then tweak each year.
