### Team "Crazy 8's" - Th√©a, Christine, Nicole, Ed
# Introductory Presentation Activity
### Grouping: Students self-select pairs (groups of 3 are ok if needed/wanted)
### Task: 
- Students have previously completed an "about me" survey (Google form) and submitted it to the instructor.
1. Students work with a partner and share their responses in order to prepare for presentations.
2. Students intorduce their partner and present their partner's information (i.e. "This is Ed. Ed lives in the Bronx and loves to..."). A presents B and B presents A (or a round robin for a group of 3).
3. Audience members applaud before/after each presentation and encourage presenters who are nervous/shy.
### Instructions/Guidance:
- The instructor models an exemplar (i.e. "This is Ducky. Ducky lives in the Bronx. Ducky loves to listen to people and help them debug their code...etc.")
- The instructor leads a class discussion on classroom culture, RESPECT (respect for all, all the time), and emotional safety/knowing you will be treated well at all times in the class (and what to do if you don't feel that way)
- During the activity, the instructor interrupts/interjects to praise desired behavior and correct any undesirable behavior
## Goals:
- Establish classroom culture
- Set the tone for collaboration in the classroom
- Get the students working in pairs/small groups right away
- Teach the mechanics for student presentations
- Get the students (more) comfortable talking/presenting to the class
-
